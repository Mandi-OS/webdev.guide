					All sites have 3 axes <b>XYZ</b>.<br>
					&nbsp <b>X</b> - width(1D), <b>Y</b> - height(2D), <b>Z</b> - level index(3D).<br>
					<span class="br5" hidden></span>
					You ask what is the layer, and why 3D if I see everything in 2D - flat?<br>
					<span class="br10" hidden></span>
					- I answer: All elements have their own height position. Imagine a box in which we we threw a bunch of soft toys, 
					closed them and we have only one transparent wall.<br> Now compress the box, and when we look through the transparent 
					wall inside it, we will see just stacked together "layers" of stuffed toys.<br>
					In the case of a website, this wall is the browser screen, and our elements are soft toys. This is how it looks like:
				</span>
				<br>
				<img src="/webdevelop.guide/storage/main/img/siteWork/levelsOnSite.webp" alt="Слои на сайтах">
				<br>
				<span>
					By default, all elements have an auto-setting - auto. However, we can also set our own value through CSS:
					<code class="code-inline">z-index: [level];</code> or JavaScript:
				</span>
				<pre><code>element.zIndex = [level];
element.style.zIndex = "[level]"; // Through styles</code></pre>
		<!-- -->
				<span>
					Mainly we use it in headers, footers, navs and dropdown menus.
				</span>
				<br>
				<span class="h2 mtop">Server-client conception</span><hr>
				<span>
					Apart from the usual local area networks, this concept is present everywhere. Its essence lies in the exchange of messages between the server and the client.<br>
					<span class="br10" hidden></span>
					<b>Client</b> is the user himself, and what happens only at him, locally, without going to the server.<br>
					<b class="link server">Server</b> is also the "control manager", it gives out instructions to all clients and stores data.<br>
					There is also often a "mailman" between the Server and the Client, or <b>Hosting</b> - one of the most famous being "Cloudflare".<br>
					<span class="br5" hidden></span>
					<b>Hosting</b> can be compared to a checkpoint. It also tries to provide a secure connection(entry\exit) and often has protection against hacker attacks.<br>
					<span class="br10" hidden></span>
					For example, on the bank page, when we go to the "Transfer History" tab, the client asks the server for this history, then processes it with a script and adds it to the list we see.<br>
					The server can return any response to the Client, but it is not certain that the Client will be able to process it correctly. Usually developers try to maximize compatibility and also add error handling.<br>
				</span>

				<span class="br20" hidden></span>
				<span class="h2 mtop">Compilation</span><hr>
				<span>
					Now about how the browser compiles our code. The browser compiles(scans, understands and executes) the site in this sequence:
				</span>
				<br>
				<img src="/webdevelop.guide/storage/main/img/siteWork/compilationQuery1.png" alt="Порядок компиляции сайта">
				<span class="br10" hidden></span>
				<span>
					Any document that we link through the &lthead&gt section has the option of using the flag <i>defer</i> and <i>async</i>.
				</span>
				<pre><code>&ltscript type="text/javascript" src="/webdevelop.guide/storage/script1.js" defer&gt&lt/script&gt
&ltscript type="text/javascript" src="/webdevelop.guide/storage/script2.js" async&gt&lt/script&gt</code></pre>
		<!-- -->
				<span>
					<i>Defer</i> means to run the script after the site compilation(i.e. HTML and CSS loading) and in the order in which all scripts with <i>defer</i> section &lthead&gt are written.<br>
					<i>Async</i> means launching the script immediately after it is loaded, regardless of the site compilation stage and position in the queue.<br>
				</span>
				<span class="br10" hidden></span>
				<span>
					<i>Async</i> in contrast to <i>defer</i> is used much less frequently.<br>
					But the use of <i>defer</i> is very important, because most sites are self-reproducing,
					that means they build themselves, and the <i>defer</i> is often an indispensable element of the work.
