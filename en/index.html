				<span>
					All sites have 3 axes <b>XYZ</b>.<br>
					&nbsp <b>X</b> - width(1D), <b>Y</b> - height(2D), <b>Z</b> - layer level(3D).<br>
					<span class="br5" hidden></span>
					You ask what is the layer, and why 3D if I see everything in 2D - flat?<br>
					<span class="br10" hidden></span>
					- I answer: All elements have their own height position. Imagine a box in which we we threw a bunch of soft toys, 
					closed them and we have only one transparent wall.<br> Now compress the box, and when we look through the transparent 
					wall inside it, we will see just stacked together "layers" of stuffed toys.<br>
					In the case of a website, this wall is the browser screen, and our elements are soft toys. This is how it looks like:
				<br>
				<img src="/webdevelop.guide/storage/main/img/siteWork/levelsOnSite.webp" alt="Site layers">
				<br>
					By default, all elements have an auto-setting - auto. However, we can also set our own value through CSS:
					<code class="code-inline">z-index: [layer-level];</code> or JavaScript:
				</span>
				<pre><code>element.zIndex = [layer-level];
element.style.zIndex = "[layer-level]"; // Through styles</code></pre>
		<!-- -->
				<span>
					Mainly we use it in headers, footers, navs and dropdown menus.
				</span>
				<br>
				<span class="h2 mtop">Server-client conception</span><hr>
				<span>
					Apart from the usual local area networks, this concept is present everywhere. Its essence lies in the exchange of messages between the server and the client.<br>
					<span class="br10" hidden></span>
					<b>Client</b> is the user himself, and what happens only at him, locally, without going to the server.<br>
					<b class="link server">Server</b> is also the "control manager", it gives out instructions to all clients and stores data.<br>
					There is also often a "mailman" between the Server and the Client, or <b>Hosting</b> - one of the most famous being "Cloudflare".<br>
					<span class="br5" hidden></span>
					<b>Hosting</b> can be compared to a KPP. It also tries to provide a secure connection(entry\exit) and often has protection against hacker attacks.<br>
					<span class="br10" hidden></span>
					For example, on the bank page, when we go to the "Transfer History" tab, the client asks the server for this history, then processes it with a script and adds it to the list we see.<br>
					The server can return any response to the Client, but it is not certain that the Client will be able to process it correctly. Usually developers try to maximize compatibility and also add error handling.<br>

				<span class="br20" hidden></span>
				</span>
				<span class="h2 mtop">Compilation</span><hr>
				<span>
					Now about how the browser <b class="dict Compilation">compiles</b> our code. The browser compiles the site in this sequence:
				<br>
				<img src="/webdevelop.guide/storage/main/img/siteWork/compilationQuery1.png" alt="Site compilation sequence">
				<span class="br10" hidden></span>
					Any document that we link through the &lthead&gt section has the option of using the <b class="dict Flag">flag</b> <i>defer</i> and <i>async</i>.
				</span>
				<pre><code>&ltscript type="text/javascript" src="/webdevelop.guide/storage/script1.js" defer&gt&lt/script&gt
&ltscript type="text/javascript" src="/webdevelop.guide/storage/script2.js" async&gt&lt/script&gt</code></pre>
		<!-- -->
				<span>
					<i>Defer</i> means to run the script after the site compilation(i.e. HTML and CSS loading) and in the order in which all scripts with <i>defer</i> section &lthead&gt are written.<br>
					<i>Async</i> means launching the script immediately after it is loaded, regardless of the site compilation stage and position in the queue.<br>
					<span class="br10" hidden></span>
					<i>Async</i> in contrast to <i>defer</i> is used much less frequently.<br>
					But the use of <i>defer</i> is very important, because most sites are <b class="dict SelfBuildingSites">self-reproducing</b>, and the <i>defer</i> is often an indispensable element of the work.
					<span class="h2">Debugging</span><hr>
					&nbspAll browsers have a debugging window, in browsers based on <b class="dict Chromium">Chromium</b> it is DevTools, in Firefox it is "Developer Tools". Often this window can be opened by pressing F12 or in the context menu, such as "Explore", "Page source code", etc.
					<span class="br5" hidden></span>
					&nbspUsually there are these <b class="dict DevTools">tabs</b>:
					<ul>
						<li><b class="dict HTMLCode">The whole compilated site source code</b></li>
						<li><b class="dict Styles">Styles</b></li>
						<li><b class="dict Console">Console</b></li>
						<li><b class="dict Sources">Sources</b></li>
						<li><b class="dict Network">Site fetches monitoring(Network)</b></li>
						<li><b class="dict Performance">Performance monitoring</b></li>
						<li><b class="dict Memory">Memory</b></li>
						<li><b class="dict Cash">Cash(App)</b></li>
						<li><b class="dict DOM">DOM</b></li>
					</ul>
					Details are <b class="link devTools">here.</b>

					<span class="br20" hidden></span>
					This was just a brief introduction to the basics. Beyond that, the more interesting it gets!

				<span class="h2">Here are all details about the concepts sorted by topics.</span><hr>
				<span class="br30"></span>
				<span id="Basic" class="h2">Basic</span><hr>
				<span>
					<ul>
						<li id="Compilation"><b>Compilation</b> - the process of converting source code into machine code, or code understandable to a compiler application (e.g. a browser).</li>
						<li id="Flag"><b>Flag</b> - variable usually equal to true(true) or false(false). For example:
							<pre><code>let drinkCoffeeAtMornings = false;
if (drinkCoffeeAtMornings) {
	Sanya.drink("Coffee");
} else {
	Sanya.say("Damn diet!")
}</code></pre>
If the flag is true(same as 1) then Sanya will drink coffee, and if the flag is false(or 0) then Sanya will complain about his hard life.
				<!--  -->
						</li>
						<li id="SelfBuildingSites"><b>Self-reproducing sites</b> - many sites are arranged in such a way that initially their page is empty, and there are only blanks. After that it is already filled with content, using scripts, and less often <b class="dict ServerInjections">server injections</b>. For example, on this site, the list of all articles at the top is populated automatically using JavaScript.</li>
						<li><b>Server injection</b> is code that is invisibly (or almost invisibly) inserted into an HTML page. For example, using PHP, the server can inject certain code depending on whatever it is.</li>
						<li id="Chromium"><b>Core(Chromium)</b> - the base on which the following application code is built. Adapted to the basic needs of the application, it eases the future programming. For example, in the case of Chromium, it is the base for some browsers, such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.</li>
						<!-- <li><b></b> - </li> -->
					</ul>
				</span>
				<span id="DevTools" class="h2 mtop">DevTools</span><hr>
				<span>
					<ul>
						<li id="HTMLCode"><b>Inspector or Elements</b> - Shows the compiled HTML-structure of the current page along with applied styles, scripts and attributes.</li>
						<li id="Styles"><b>Styles</b> - Here you can view and edit all stylesheets, and in addition At-rules.</li>
						<li id="Console"><b>Console</b> - To execute commands in real time, output errors and logs.</li>
						<li id="Sources"><b>Debugger or Sources</b> - All connected files and source code maps. In text documents you can set break points for debugging.</li>
						<li id="Network"><b>Network</b> - Allows you to track all requests from the site: their type, status, load time, request and response.</li>
						<li id="Performance"><b>Performance</b> - To record and analyze page performance, including FPS, CPU load, rendering latency. For example, you can start recording, then start loading the game, stop recording, and see how it loads the system.</li>
						<li id="Memory"><b>Memory</b> - Used for analyzing memory leaks, tracking consumption, and cleaning up unnecessary objects. Rarely used.</li>
						<li id="Cash"><b>App</b> - Allows you to view the entire cache: Local Storage, Session Storage, IndexedDB(very large local storage), Services and Cookies.</li>
						<li id="DOM"><b>DOM</b> - Full access to the generated DOM structure - how the browser sees our site.</li>
